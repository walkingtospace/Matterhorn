The new file, new_file, will be used to test the KVClient class. It will contain a series of tests that will check the functionality of the KVClient class, such as testing the get, set, and delete methods, as well as testing the performance of the KVClient. The tests will also measure the average time for each type of operation. The new file will also include a clean target task to ensure that the tests are properly executed.
